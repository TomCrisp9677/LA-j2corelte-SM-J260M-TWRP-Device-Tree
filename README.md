# LA-j2corelte-SM-J260M-TWRP-Device-Tree
Credits to @SebaUbuntu for his great tool! , I'm going to test the image for the device model stated above.
This is the 1/3 part of the twrp-building main directories that we need for compiling a recovery.img for the SM-J260M . Specific model: J260MUBSDAUJ3 . With the CSC code from EON (Ecuador) that can come in handy for flashing.
Work in progress. The other 2/3 parts are mainly comprised of the kernel_samsung_j2corelte or /Android/kernel/samsung/j2corelte and the /Android/vendor/samsung/j2corelte . Results will be published after we are able to finally compile the full recoveryimage. Thank you
